# Leptospirosis-prediction-model
A classification model which classify a person as whether having or not the Leptospirosis based on clinical, environmental and demographic factors.

## The repositary contains the following files
Lepto1_classical model.ipynb - A python notebook which contains the data preprocessing part, EDA and the classical statistical modelling for the classification.
Lepto.ipynb - A notebook which consists of the Data preprocessing part, Descriptive analysis and the advanced model fitting (Machine Learning) part for the dataset.

A thorough data preprocessing and feature engineering part was done because the dataset was consisted of nearly 800 variables.

In the EDA part also the significant variables were identified.

The models here occupied were,
* Logistic regression as the benchmark model
* Ridge regression
* Lasso regression
* Decision Tree
* SVM
* Random Forest
* XG boost

The best model was the XG boost model which got nearly 92% accuracy while benchmark model achieved 90% accuracy.
