# Leptospirosis-prediction-model
A classification model which classify a person as whether having or not the Leptospirosis based on clinical, environmental and demographic factors.

## The repositary contains the following files

Lepto.ipynb - A notebook which consists of the Data preprocessing part, Descriptive analysis and the advanced model fitting part for the dataset.

A thorough data preprocessing and feature engineering part was done because the dataset was consisted of nearly 800 variables.

In the EDA part also the significant variables were identified.

The models here occupied were,
* Logistic regression as the benchmark model
* Ridge regression
* Lasso regression
* Decision Tree
* SVM
* Random Forest
* XG boost

The best model was the XG boost model which got nearly 91% accuracy.
